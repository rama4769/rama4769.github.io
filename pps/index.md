Examples of sorting algorithms are merge sort, bubble sort, selection sort, and others. And examples of searching algorithms are exponential search, binary search, jump search, and others.

There are other types of algorithms like hashing, greeting algorithms, brute force algorithms, and more.

You can write algorithms with any programming language out there. Each programming language has its way of implementing a particular algorithm.

At the end of the day, no matter which language you use, an algorithm is still an algorithm. For instance, you can implement a bubble sort algorithm or any other type of algorithm with any programming language.
